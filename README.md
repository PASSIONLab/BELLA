# BELLA - Berkeley Efficient Long-Read to Long-Read Aligner and Overlapper

BELLA is a computationally efficient and highly accurate long-read to long-read aligner and overlapper. BELLA uses a k-mer seed-based approach to detect overlaps between noisy, long-read data. BELLA provides a novel algorithm for pruning k-mers that are unlikely to be useful in overlap detection and whose presence would only incur unnecessary computational costs. This reliable k-mers detection algorithm explicitly maximizes the probability of retaining k-mers that belong to unique regions of the genome.
To achieve fast overlapping without sketching, BELLA uses sparse matrix-matrix multiplication and utilizes high-performance software and libraries developed for this sparse matrix subroutine. BELLA’s overlap detection has been coupled with a state-of-the-art [seed-and-extend banded-alignment](https://github.com/seqan/seqan) method. BELLA’s alignment step implements a new method to separate true alignments from false positives depending on the alignment score.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

**COMPILER:** the software **requires gcc-6 or higher** with OpenMP to be compiled.  
To run the evaluation test python3 and simplesam package are required. It can be installed via pip: 
```
pip install simplesam
```

### Installing

Clone the repository and enter it:

```
cd bella
```
Build using makefile:

```
ln -s makefile-nersc Makefile && make bella
```

## Running BELLA

To run with default setting:
```
./bella -i <text-file-listing-all-input-fastq-files> -o <out-filename> -d <depth>
```
BELLA requires a text file containing the path to the input fastq file(s) as the argument for the -i option.
Example: [input-example.txt](https://github.com/giuliaguidi/bella/files/2620924/input-example.txt)

To show the usage:
```
./bella -h
```

Optional flag description: 
```
-i : list of fastq(s) (required)
-o : output filename (required)
-d : depth (required)
-k : k-mer length [17]
-a : fixed alignment threshold [50]
-x : alignment x-drop factor [7]
-e : error rate [auto estimated from fastq]
-m : total RAM of the system in MB [auto estimated if possible or 8,000 if not]
-z : skip the pairwise alignment [false]
-w : relaxMargin parameter for alignment on edges [300]
-c : alignment score deviation from the mean [0.1]
-n : filter out alignment on edge [false]
-r : kmerRift: bases separating two k-mers used as seeds for a read [1,000]
-K : all (non-overlapping and separated by <kmerRift> bases) k-mers as alignment seeds [false]
-f : k-mer list from Jellyfish (required if #DEFINE JELLYFISH enabled)
-p : output in PAF format [false]
```
**NOTE**: to use [Jellyfish](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/jellyfish/) k-mer counting is necessary to enable **#DEFINE JELLYFISH.**

The parallelism depends on the available number of threads and on the available RAM [Default: 8000MB]. Use -DLINUX for Linux or -DOSX for macOS at compile time to estimate available RAM from your machine.

## Output Format

BELLA outputs alignments in a format similar to [BLASR's M4 format](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/blasr/wiki/Blasr-Output-Format). Example output (tab-delimited):

```HTML
[A ID] [B ID] [# shared k-mers] [alignment score] [overlap length] [n=B fwd, c=B rc] [A start] [A end] [A length] [B start] [B end] [B length]
```
The positions are zero-based and are based on the forward strand, whatever which strand the sequence is mapped.
If **-p** option is used, BELLA outputs alignments in [PAF format](https://github.com/lh3/miniasm/blob/master/PAF.md). Example output (tab-delimited):

```HTML
[A ID] [A length] [A start] [A end] ["+" = B fwd, "-" = B rc] [B ID] [B length] [B start] [B end] [alignment score] [overlap length] [mapping quality]
```

## Performance Evaluation

The repository contains also the code to get the recall/precision of BELLA and other long-read aligners (Minimap, Minimap2, DALIGNER, MHAP and BLASR).

**Ground truth generation for real data set**: SAMparser.py allows to transform the BWA-MEM/Minimap2 .sam output file in a simpler format usable as input to the evaluation code when using real data set. 

```
python3 SAMparser.py <bwamem/minimap2-output>
```

**Ground truth generation for synthetic data set**: mafconvert.py allows to transform the .MAF file from PBSIM (Pacbio read simulator) in a simpler format usable as input to the evaluation code when using synthetic data set.

```
python mafconvert.py axt <maf-file> > <ground-truth.txt>
```

To run the evaluation program:
```
cd bench
```
```
make result
```
```
./result -G <grouth-truth-file> [-B <bella-output>] [-m <minimap/minimap2-output>] [-D <daligner-output>] [-L <blasr-output>] [-H <mhap-output>] [-M <mecat-output>] [-i <mecat-idx2read-file>]
```
If the output of BELLA is in PAF format, you should run it using minimap2 **-m** flag.

To show the usage:
```
./result -h
```
**NOTE**: add -z flag if simulated data is used.

## Demo 

You can download an _E. coli_ 30X dataset [here](https://bit.ly/2EEq3JM) to test BELLA. For this dataset, you can use the following single mapped ground truth to run the evaluation code: [ecsample_singlemapped_q10.txt](https://github.com/giuliaguidi/bella/files/3143607/ecsample_singlemapped_q10.txt). A detailed description of the procedure we use to generate the ground truth for real data can be found in our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/464420).

You can run the evaluation code located in /bench folder as: 

```./result -G ecsample_singlemapped_q10.txt -B <bella-output>```
